# Automated-Batch-Foreign-PDF-machine-translator

### OVERVIEW
This program translates non english PDFs to English with original source material side by side with machine produced translated output for comparison and study purposes.

First, the text will be extracted from the PDF file/s and then the text is translated.
The original text will be presented alongside with translated text for comparison purposes in the final DOCX output.

As PDFs can be finicky due to how the text is presented and formatted, the extraction of text may not be 100% depending on your source PDF file. 

#### Example
The Chinese version of the instruction manual for the video game 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms X' has been translated. Issue with this PDF is that the text is not organised like a simple WORD document and so text extraction is messy. However, this program still saves a lot of time compared to manually copy and pasting desired bits of text into say 'Google Translate'.
